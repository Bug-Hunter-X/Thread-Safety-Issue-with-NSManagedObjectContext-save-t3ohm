This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C when working with Core Data's `NSManagedObjectContext`.  Saving the context from a background thread directly is incorrect and can lead to crashes or data inconsistencies. The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code.  The solution, shown in `bugSolution.m`, utilizes the `performBlock:` method to correctly save the context on the main thread.
